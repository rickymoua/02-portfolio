      About Me 
    </h2>
  
    <p> Hello, my name is Ricky. I've been interested in coding for a while now and finally started my journey by joining a bootcamp.
     I have a decent amount of experince in the pharmaceutical industry so switching career to the tech industry will be difficult but it is a challenge i'm ready to take. If more questions are still needed from me, 
     feel free to contact me.

      <h2>Work projects</h2>
          <p> 
            I have worked in a mini project with a small group of four people to make and style a CSS sheet. This helped me understand the concept better and also created a nice website.
